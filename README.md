# YARC - Yet Another Reddit Client

To run this app, you need to have a Reddit API client ID. You can get these by creating a new app on the [Reddit API website](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

Once you have your client ID, you can run the app by setting the following environment variables:

flutter run --dart-define=REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
